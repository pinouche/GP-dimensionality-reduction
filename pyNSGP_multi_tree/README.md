# pyNSGP
This Python 3 code is an implementation of multi-objective genetic programming using NSGA-II for symbolic regression.

![example use of pyNSGP for symbolic regression](https://github.com/marcovirgolin/pyNSGP/blob/master/example_pic.jpeg?raw=true)


## Dependencies
Numpy & scikit-learn.

## Installation
Run `pip install --user .` from within the folder.

## Example 
pyNSGP can be run as a scikit-learn regression estimator. See `test.py` for an example. 
The first objective is the mean-squared-error, the second is solution size. If `use_interpretability_model=True` is used, then the second objective is implemented by predicting human-interpretability according to the linear model found in the paper referenced below.
